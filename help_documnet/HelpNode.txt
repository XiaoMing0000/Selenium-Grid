$ java -jar selenium-server-4.1.2.jar node --help
Usage: node [options]
  Options:
    --allow-cors
      Whether the Selenium server should allow web browser connections from
      any host
      Default: false
    --bind-bus
      Whether the connection string should be bound or connected. When true,
      the component will be bound to the Event Bus (as in the Event Bus will
      also be started by the component, typically by the Distributor and the
      Hub). When false, the component will connect to the Event Bus.
    --bind-host
      Whether the server should bind to the host address/name, or only use it
      to report its reachable url. Helpful in complex network topologies where
      the server cannot report itself with the current IP/hostname but rather
      an external IP or hostname (e.g. inside a Docker container).
      Default: true
    --config
      Config file to read from (may be specified more than once)
    --config-help
      Output detailed information about config options
      Default: false
    --detect-drivers
      Autodetect which drivers are available on the current system, and add
      them to the Node.
      Default: true
    --docker, -D
      Docker configs which map image name to stereotype capabilities (example:
      -D selenium/standalone-firefox:latest '{"browserName": "firefox"}')
    --docker-assets-path
      Absolute path where assets will be stored
    --docker-host
      Host name where the docker daemon is running
    --docker-port
      Port where the docker daemon is running
    --docker-url
      URL for connecting to the docker daemon
    --docker-video-image
      Docker image to be used when video recording is enabled
      Default: selenium/video:latest
    --driver-configuration
      List of configured drivers a Node supports. It is recommended to provide
      this type of configuration through a toml config file to improve
      readability. Command line example: --drivers-configuration
      display-name="Firefox Nightly" max-sessions=2
      webdriver-path="/usr/local/bin/geckodriver" stereotype='{"browserName":
      "firefox", "browserVersion": "86", "moz:firefoxOptions":
      {"binary":"/Applications/Firefox
      Nightly.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin"}}'
    --driver-factory
      Mapping of fully qualified class name to a browser configuration that
      this matches against. --driver-factory
      org.openqa.selenium.example.LynxDriverFactory '{"browserName": "lynx"}'
    -I, --driver-implementation
      Drivers that should be checked. If specified, will skip
      autoconfiguration. Example: -I "firefox" -I "chrome"
      Default: []
    --events-implementation
      Full classname of non-default event bus implementation
    --grid-url
      Public URL of the Grid as a whole (typically the address of the Hub or
      the Router)
    --heartbeat-period
      How often, in seconds, will the Node send heartbeat events to the
      Distributor to inform it that the Node is up.
      Default: 60
    --host
      Server IP or hostname: usually determined automatically.
    --http-logs
      Enable http logging. Tracing should be enabled to log http logs.
      Default: false
    --https-certificate
      Server certificate for https. Get more detailed information by running
      "java -jar selenium-server.jar info security"
    --https-private-key
      Private key for https. Get more detailed information by running "java
      -jar selenium-server.jar info security"
    --hub
      The address of the Hub in a Hub-and-Node configuration. This can be a
      plain hostname or IP address (`hostname`), in which case the Hub will be
      assumed to be `http://hostname:4444`, the `--grid-url` will be the same,
      `--publish-events` will be `tcp://hostname:4442` and
      `--subscribe-events` will be `tcp://hostname:4443`. If `hostname`
      contains a port number, that will be used for `--grid-url` but the URIs
      for the event bus will remain the same. Any of these default values may
      be overridden but setting the correct flags. If the hostname has  a
      protocol (such as `https`) that will be used too.
    --log
      File to write out logs. Ensure the file path is compatible with the
      operating system's file path. Windows path example:
      \\path\to\file\gridlog.log OR C:\path\path\to\file\gridlog.log
      Linux/Unix/MacOS path example: /path/to/file/gridlog.log
    --log-encoding
      Log encoding
    --log-level
      Log level. Default logging level is INFO. Log levels are described here
      https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/Level.html
      Default: INFO
    --log-timestamp-format
      Format of the timestamp in log output
    --max-sessions
      Maximum number of concurrent sessions. Default value is the number of
      available processors.
      Default: 4
    --max-threads
      Maximum number of listener threads. Default value is: (available
      processors) * 3.
      Default: 12
    --node-implementation
      Full classname of non-default Node implementation. This is used to
      manage a session's lifecycle.
      Default: org.openqa.selenium.grid.node.local.LocalNodeFactory
    --override-max-sessions
      The # of available processors is the recommended max sessions value (1
      browser session per processor). Setting this flag to true allows the
      recommended max value to be overwritten. Session stability and
      reliability might suffer as the host could run out of resources.
      Default: false
    --plain-logs
      Use plain log lines
      Default: true
    -p, --port
      Port to listen on. There is no default as this parameter is used by
      different components, for example Router/Hub/Standalone will use 4444
      and Node will use 5555.
    --publish-events
      Connection string for publishing events to the event bus
    --register-cycle
      How often, in seconds, the Node will try to register itself for the
      first time to the Distributor.
      Default: 10
    --register-period
      How long, in seconds, will the Node try to register to the Distributor
      for the first time. After this period is completed, the Node will not
      attempt to register again.
      Default: 120
    --registration-secret
      Node registration secret
    --service-configuration
      Configuration for the service where calls will be relayed to. It is
      recommended to provide this type of configuration through a toml config
      file to improve readability. Command line example:
      --service-configuration max-sessions=2 stereotype='{"browserName":
      "safari", "platformName": "iOS", "appium:platformVersion": "14.5"}}'
    --service-host

    --service-port
      Port where the service that supports WebDriver commands is running
    --service-status-endpoint
      Endpoint to query the WebDriver service status, an HTTP 200 response is
      expected
    --service-url
      URL for connecting to the service that supports WebDriver commands, like
      an Appium server or a cloud service.
    --session-timeout
      Let X be the session-timeout in seconds. The Node will automatically
      kill a session that has not had any activity in the last X seconds. This
      will release the slot for other tests.
      Default: 300
	  
    --structured-logs

    --version
      Displays the version and exits.
      Default: false
