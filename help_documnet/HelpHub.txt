$ java -jar selenium-server-4.1.2.jar hub --help
Usage: hub [options]
  Options:

      Whether the Selenium server should allow web browser connections from
      any host
      Default: false
    --bind-bus
      Whether the connection string should be bound or connected. When true,
      the component will be bound to the Event Bus (as in the Event Bus will
      also be started by the component, typically by the Distributor and the
      Hub). When false, the component will connect to the Event Bus.
    --bind-host
      Whether the server should bind to the host address/name, or only use it
      to report its reachable url. Helpful in complex network topologies where
      the server cannot report itself with the current IP/hostname but rather
      an external IP or hostname (e.g. inside a Docker container).

      Default: true
    -p, --port
